## ACADEMICS
**Research Assistant (contract period 2021/10 - 2022/09) supervised by Prof Brian Sheil, at the Engineering Department (University of Oxford)**		     
The project aims to develop an intelligent model for pile installation drivability forecasting via Bayesian analysis. Cooperating with the experts in Physics and Engineering, my role is to analyze the real data and interpret the statistical results into engineering terms. Specifically, it involves Bayesian modeling and inference, model comparison and evaluation, and some machine learning techniques etc.        

**Dissertation (2021/06-2021/09): Clustered Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning (BIRL) in clinical trials, supervised by Prof Mihaela van der Schaar (vanderSchaar Lab) and Prof Mihai Cucuringu (University of Oxford)**     
Based on synthetic clinical trials, train a deep learning model to imitate the reward and learn the policy (i.e. how doctors make clinical decisions) in a Markov chain dynamic environment. It is also designed for the multi-reward scenario, where different doctors of different characteristics make different decisions. This model learns the number of characteristics among the doctors, captures the multiple rewards and learns the various behaviors among the clinicians.           

**Training Cascaded Classifier to discover/mine the risk factors of top diseases that affects the public health among the United States (2020-2021), Supervised by PhD Yao Xiao of MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas**      
Training the Classifier using an “appropriate combination” of the statistical machine learning metrics like the random forests, boost, Bayesian, GLM, etc., and evaluate the Classifier based off its predictive performance using precision, recall, cross validation, etc. The data was extracted from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSS), an open data source of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.       

**Research Assistant of Risk Lab (2019-2020), U of T. Supervised by Prof. Luis Seco and Prof Alik Solokov**          
Participated as a team leader in the research project for undergraduates at Risk lab, University of Toronto.        
-	Research interests: Currently implemented algorithmic trading strategies of cryptocurrency. NLP metrics for embedding financial signals/indicators and market sentiments, e.g. transformer model.        

**From Reinforcement Learning to Stock Trading (2019), Supervised by Prof. Keith Knight**            
The study mainly focuses on methods, including Tabular Method and Approximation Method in reinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning. The study also introduces the concept of neural network, to discuss and explore how to better apply this statistical method into the financial services industry, help with tasks such as stock trading, risk control and portfolio management.       

**Data Analysis Report Regarding Smoking Behaviors Among American Teenagers Using Generalized Linear Models (2019), Supervised by Prof. Patrick Brown**      
Analyzed the prevalence of different smoking practices among minors according to data from the 2014 U.S. Census. Summarized certain patterns, such as that the Caucasian underage people are more likely to smoke tobacco in a particular way than underage minors of other ethnic groups in the United States, given all other factors (e.g. gender, living region, etc.) fixed.        

**Time Series Analysis Project Regarding Portfolio Construction and Return Prediction Based on Dow Jones 30 (2018), Supervised by Prof. Jen-wen Lin**      
Based on historical trading data from the 30 constituent stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, modeled with SARIMA model of time series. Use historical data to evaluate several portfolios that are constantly self-updated with different trading strategies, calculate parameters such as yield, volatility, with the assistance of 60 months rolling window, and rate each trading strategy.           

**Data Analysis Project Regarding Government Bond Yield Predictions Using Linear Interpolation and PCA (2018), Supervised by Prof. Luis Seco**        
Based on parts of historical data on Canadian government bonds and Ontario government bonds, this project aims to make prediction and make comparison with real data for the yield curve and forward rate curve of bonds for some past years. This project introduces multiple methods, including linear interpolation, to find the optimal forecasting method, and hence, to predict future curves and conduct principle component analysis to historical data.
